# Static Methods

```java
public class Mouse {

    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("squeak squeak");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        speak();
    }

}
```

The `main` method compiles and produces the following output when run:

```text
squeak squeak
```
