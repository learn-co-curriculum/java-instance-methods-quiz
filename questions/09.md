# Constructors

Java generates a default no-args constructor for the `Party` class,
so the `main` method can call it with:
`Party superbowlParty = new Party();`

```java
public class Party {
    private int pizzaCount;
    private int guestCount;

    public Party(int pizzaCount, int guestCount) {
        this.pizzaCount = pizzaCount;
        this.guestCount = guestCount;
    }

    public Party(int guestCount) {
        this.guestCount = guestCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Party superbowlParty = new Party();
    }

}
```

## Incorrect

True

> That is not correct. Java only generates a default no-args constructor if you don't define
> any constructors.  Since two constructors are defined, Java will not generate a no-args constructor.

## Correct

False
