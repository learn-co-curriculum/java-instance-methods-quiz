# Methods

Which methods compile and increment `currentPage` by 1? Select all that apply.

```java
public class Book {
    private int totalPages;
    private int currentPage;
}
```

## Correct

```java
public void turnPage() {
    currentPage++;
}
```

> Correct! The method must not include static, since we need to
> modified the instance variable `currentPage`.  The variable
> is not shadowed, so we can access it using the simple name `currentPage`.

## Correct

```java
public void turnPage() {
    this.currentPage++;
}
```

> Correct! The method must not include static, since we need to
> modified the instance variable `currentPage`.  Since it is an
> instance method, we can use the implicit parameter `this` to access
> the instance variable.

## Incorrect

```java
public static void turnPage() {
    currentPage++;
}
```

> Sorry, that is not correct. A static method does not have
> the implicit parameter `this` and can't reference 
> an instance variable without an explicit object reference.


## Incorrect

```java
public static void turnPage() {
    this.currentPage++;
}
```

> Sorry, that is not correct. A static method does not have
