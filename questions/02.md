# Variable Shadowing

```java
public class Party {
    
    private int pizzaCount;
    private int guestCount;

    public void orderMorePizzas(int quantity) {
        this.pizzaCount += quantity;
    }

    public void setGuestCount(int guestCount){
        this.guestCount = guestCount;
    }

}
```

The `setGuestCount` method can be updated to replace `this.guestCount`
with just `guestCount`, and the code would compile and
produce the same result.

## Incorrect

True

> Sorry, that is not correct.  The `setGuestCount` method defines a parameter variable
> named `guestCount`, so the instance variable `guestCount` is shadowed by the
> parameter variable.  The method must use the qualified name
> `this.guestCount` to refer to the instance variable.
