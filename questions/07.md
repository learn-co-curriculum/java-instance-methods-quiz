```java
public class Party {
    private int pizzaCount;
    private int guestCount;

    public Party(int pizzaCount, int guestCount) {
        this.pizzaCount = pizzaCount;
        this.guestCount = guestCount;
    }

    public Party(int guestCount) {
        this.guestCount = guestCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Party superbowlParty = new Party(5, 50);
        System.out.println(superbowlParty.pizzaCount);
        System.out.println(superbowlParty.guestCount);
    }

}
```
