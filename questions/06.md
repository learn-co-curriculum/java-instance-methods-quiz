# Variable Shadowing


```java
public class Book {
    private int totalPages;
    private int currentPage;

    public void turnToPage(int page) {
        this.currentPage = page;
    }
}
```

The parameter `page` shadows the instance variable `currentPage`.

## Incorrect

True

> That is incorrect.  The parameter `page` does not have the same
> name as the instance variable `currentPage`, thus it does not shadow it.  We
> could rewrite the assignment statement as `currentPage = page`.
